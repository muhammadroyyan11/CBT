<p>Imagine 15 grocery bags filled with plastic trash piled up on every single yard of shoreline in the world. That’s how much land-based plastic trash ended up in the world’s oceans in just one year. The world generates at least 3.5 million tons of plastic and other solid waste a day, 10 times the amount a century ago, according to World Bank researchers. The U.S. is the king of trash, producing a world-leading 250 million tons a year—roughly 4.4 pounds of trash per person per day. And yet there are a growing number of people—often young millennial women—who are part of a zero-waste movement. Their yearly trash output can be small enough to fit inside an eight-ounce mason jar. These are not <strong>wannabe hippies</strong>, but people embracing a modern minimalist lifestyle. They say it saves them money and time and enriches their lives. Kathryn Kellogg is one of those young millennials who has downsized her trash pile—anything that hasn’t been composted or recycled—so two years' worth literally fits inside one 16-ounce jar. Meanwhile, the average American produces 1,500 pounds of trash a year. (Learn more about Kellogg in the recent plastic issue of National Geographic magazine). “We also saved about $5,000 a year by purchasing fresh food instead of packaged, buying in bulk, and making our own products like cleaners and deodorant,” says Kellogg, who lives with her husband in a small house in Vallejo, California. Kellogg is one of several zero-waste bloggers who share online the details of their efforts, along with practical tips and encouragement, for others looking to embrace a zero-waste lifestyle. In three years, she has gained 300,000 monthly readers on her blog goingzerowaste.com and on Instagram. “I think many people are ready to cut their waste,” says Kellogg. However, she doesn’t want people to fixate on trying to stuff all their trash into a jar. Zero Waste is really about trying to minimize your trash and making better choices in your life, she says. “Just do the best you can and buy less.”</p>

<p>What is the definition of zero-waste as stated by Kellogg?\</p>

<p>Trying to put all their trash into a jar\</p>

<p>Producing no waste at all\</p>

<p>Do your best to escalate shopping\</p>

<p>Make new choices in life \</p>

<p>Make better choices to diminish waste production\</p>

<p>In the 1930s, Chester F. Carlson was working in the patents department of a large electronics firm in New York City. One of the major problems in his work was the length of time and expense involved in getting patents copied, patents were lengthy legal documents, and the only ways to get them copied were to take them to a typist or to take them to a photographer. Either way of copying patents took a lot of time and cost a lot of money. He came up with the idea for a machine that would copy documents quickly and efficiently. He researched the idea in the library and then worked over a three-year period on developing a machine that used a light, an electro statically charged plate, and powder to duplicate images on paper. The result of this work was a machine that produced the first xerographic copy on October 22, 1938. He named the process "Xerox", which means "dry writing". Carlson felt that he had a good idea, one that would be extremely helpful in the business world. He tried to sell his idea to a number of large corporations, but they were not terribly interested in his machine. A few years later he sold the process to a small family-owned company. This small company grew into the giant Xerox Corporation, and both Carlson and Xerox became rather wealthy in the process.</p>

<p>Our study showed that living in a deprived area does affect mental health – at least in men. In fact, we found that men living in the most deprived areas were 51% more likely to experience depression than those living in areas that were not deprived. Interestingly, the results did not reach statistical significance in women.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Out study did not set out to determine why this might be the case – and further research is now needed to do this. Nevertheless, it is possible that many men in the UK and other parts of the world still feel a primary responsibility to provide for and support their families.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A recent study investigating depression risks for men and women indicated that men are more affected by “failures at key instrumental tasks, such as expected work achievements and failures to provide adequately for the family”.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Research shows that men seem to be more sensitive to certain stressors in their environment compared to women, such as these related to work and finances. Women's depression levels, on the other hand, are more influenced by stressors stemming from relationships and the social networks they are embedded in. Factors such as low parental warmth and low marital satisfaction, for example, can really affect women's mental health.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A great many factors may be behind this, but in the UK, men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women and so root causes as to why men are struggling should be investigated.

Again, further work is needed on the effect of the residential environment on mental health from a gender perspective.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>High numbers of people are living in deprivation around the world and depression is a leading cause of disability or a global scale. Knowing how men and women are affected by the hardship of living in deprivation can help focus mental health treatment, and this is a valuable step forward.</p>

<p>Genders play a big role in determining the intensity of people suffering from mood distraction \</p>

<p>The effect of the residential atmosphere on mental disorder from a gender approach is unreliable.\</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It can be implied from the passage that ...\</p>

<p>why certain men and women suffer from the hardship of living may help medicine identify the cause of their mental disorder. \</p>

<p>other culprits like low parental approach and marital dissatisfaction may impact male's mental distortion.\</p>

<p>women are at a lower risk of depression than men in hectic areas due to the swing of their mood. \</p>

<p>people have tendency to suffer from psychological disturbance because of different gender treatments. \</p>

<p>diagnosing the way people get impacted by the misery of life is an alternative of choosing the kinds of mental health curation\</p>
